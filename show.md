# What is WCAG?
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of internationally recognized standards developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure digital content is accessible to people with disabilities. They are organized around four principles (POUR): Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust, with three compliance levels (A, AA, AAA)

### Purpose: 
Ensure web content is accessible to individuals with visual, auditory, motor, cognitive, and other disabilities.

### Versions: 
WCAG 2.0 (2008), 2.1 (2018), and 2.2 (2023). Most organizations target WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.

# Requirement Structure

1. Perceivable: Content must be presented in ways users can perceive (e.g., text alternatives, captions).
2. Operable: Interface components must be navigable via keyboard, voice, or other tools.
3. Understandable: Content and navigation must be clear and predictable.
4. Robust: Content must work across current and future technologies (e.g., compatible with assistive tools).
